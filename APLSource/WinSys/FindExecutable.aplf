⍝ Returns the name of the file associated with the extension of `filename`.\\
⍝ For "foo.html" it fires up the default browser, for example.
⍝ The optional parameter `directory` allows you to set the default directory.\\
⍝ Note that you cannot fake a filename in order to find out what program is
⍝ associated with a particular extension. The contents of the file, however,
⍝ doesn't matter at all.\\
⍝ `exe`: either empty (see `rc`) or the path to the exe which can handle `filename`.\\
⍝ `rc`: 0 in case of success, otherwise one of:
 SE_ERR_FNF←2          ⍝ The specified file was not found.
 SE_ERR_PNF←3          ⍝ The specified path is invalid.
 SE_ERR_ACCESSDENIED←5 ⍝ The specified file cannot be accessed.
 SE_ERR_OOM←8          ⍝ The system is out of memory or resources.
 SE_ERR_NOASSOC←31     ⍝ There is no association for the specified file type with an executable file.
